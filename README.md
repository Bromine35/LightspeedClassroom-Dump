# LightspeedClassroom-Dump
Dump of Lightspeed Classroom extension

I found this online and nobody in Bromine has LS Classroom so I can't even confirm if it works or not. If you wanted to look at the files you can do that now I guess, I don't know if this works as intended though. Nobody uses ls classroom anyways
